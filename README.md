# Django Learning Journey :rocket:

Just for fun! I'm currently in the process of learning Django, and I plan to update this README throughout my course. :smiley:

## Progress Log

### Day 1
- Found it a bit confusing, but the first course's project pushed me to learn well.

### Day 7
- Now, I have a better understanding of Django and its environment.
- CSS & HTML are currently out of my league :)) They're easy to catch, though.
- At this point, I prefer to keep my focus on the main concept rather than CSS & HTML.
