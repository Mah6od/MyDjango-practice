Just for fun!
I'm in learning process of django and i want to edit these files during my course :)))

*Day 1: it was a bit confusing but first course's project pushed me well

*Day 7: now i have better understanding of Django and its environment.
css & html is out of my league for now :))
at this point, i prefer to keep focus on Django concepts rather than css & html.
