Just for fun!
I'm in learning process of django and i want to edit these files during my course :)))

*Day 1: it was a bit confusing but first course's project pushed me well

Day 7: Now I have a better understanding of Django and its environment. CSS & HTML are out of my league for now :))
They're easy to catch, though. At this point, I prefer to keep my focus on the main concept rather than CSS & HTML.
